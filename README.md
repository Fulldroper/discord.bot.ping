The purpose of the project was to create a Discord bot that generates temporary mentions of users in text channels to attract attention to content.

The project is useful as it helps moderators and users highlight important messages or announcements by temporarily pinging relevant members.

## How the project works

The bot connects to a Discord server and listens for specific commands. When a user issues a command to ping someone, the bot mentions the specified user in the text channel and then deletes the mention after a set period.

### Algorithm and Code Examples

1. **Connecting to Discord Server**
```javascript
const Discord = require('discord.js');
const client = new Discord.Client();
client.login('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN');
client.on('ready', () => {
  console.log('Logged in as ' + client.user.tag + '!');
});
```

2. **Listening for Ping Commands**
```javascript
client.on('message', message => {
  if (message.content.startsWith('!ping')) {
    const user = message.mentions.users.first();
    if (user) {
      message.channel.send(`Hey ${user}, you were pinged!`).then(msg => {
        setTimeout(() => msg.delete(), 5000); // Deletes the message after 5 seconds
      });
    }
  }
});
```
